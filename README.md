It's a robot that collect hot topics about machine learning at Reddit. And then tweet these topics 
to two popular Chinese social networks, Weibo and Renren.

## Why made it?
* First, to overcome information deluge. We only care about real usage information.

* Second, make more Chinese people learn what's happening on machine learning.

* Last, it can be used as a proxy, you know some foreign websites are blocked misteriously in China, 
We can fetch those messages and let's people know what's happend of the world.
